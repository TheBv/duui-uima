# Transcription NeMo

DUUI implementation of [NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo).


# How To Use

For using duui-transcription-nemo as a DUUI image it is necessary to use the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface (DUUI)](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/DockerUnifiedUIMAInterface).

## Start Docker container

```
docker run --rm -p 1000:9714 docker.texttechnologylab.org/duui-transcription-nemo:latest
```

Find all available image tags here: https://docker.texttechnologylab.org/v2/duui-transcription-nemo/tags/list

Note: you might need to add `--ipc=host` to the docker run command for memory sharing, depending on your setup

## Run within DUUI

```
composer.add(
    new DUUIDockerDriver.Component("docker.texttechnologylab.org/duui-transcription-nemo:latest")
        .withScale(iWorkers)
        .withImageFetching()
);
```

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `domain_type` | Either `meeting`, `telephonic` or `general` |

  abstract  = {Automatic analysis of large corpora is a complex task, especially
               in terms of time efficiency. This complexity is increased by the
               fact that flexible, extensible text analysis requires the continuous
               integration of ever new tools. Since there are no adequate frameworks
               for these purposes in the field of NLP, and especially in the
               context of UIMA, that are not outdated or unusable for security
               reasons, we present a new approach to address the latter task:
               Docker Unified UIMA Interface (DUUI), a scalable, flexible, lightweight,
               and feature-rich framework for automatic distributed analysis
               of text corpora that leverages Big Data experience and virtualization
               with Docker. We evaluate DUUI{'}s communication approach against
               a state-of-the-art approach and demonstrate its outstanding behavior
               in terms of time efficiency, enabling the analysis of big text
               data.}
